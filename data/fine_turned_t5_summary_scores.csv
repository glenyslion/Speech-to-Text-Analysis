perseverance in the practice of the mosaic rights their churches have disappeared their books are obliterated their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith and the softness of their infant creed would be variously molded by the zeal or prudence of years yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of christ his progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom and after a painful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross he lived and died for the service of mankind but the life and death of socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of jesus the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity the son of a virgin generated by the ineffable operation of the holy spirit was a creature without example or resemblance superior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of adam nor could it seem strange or incredible that the first of these eons the logos or word of god of the same substance with the father should descend upon earth to deliver the human race from vice and error and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality but the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent and even the depravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east many among the gentile presulites refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously absurd the humanity of christ he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies but the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the dosi who taught not that christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an

than climbing the mountain is going around its warm fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers perhaps the profession of doing good may be full but everybody should be kind at least to himself go quietly alone no harm will befall you but it is far better to go a foot one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether as wood for fires is everywhere abundant only a little food will be required thus ones sulters on and on in the glorious radiance in utter peace and forgetfulness of time yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull looking when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable invitation as if not at home at such time its height seems much less as if crouching and weary it were taking rest every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital whirl and rush and though many feet and wings are folded how many are a stir slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a trip around the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath wellfetched trees that shed the rain like a roof then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of bird song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chaparral a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finally blended they seem a part of the night itself and make a deeper silence and setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a few miles you may see in approaching it its suspiciouslooking yellowspotted hood and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands as if you were approaching a dangerous snake it is lined with emerald algae and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting it is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about feet above sea level in moreane sprinkled ice cliffs feet high the long grey slopes leading up to the glacier seem remarkably smooth and unbroken most of the drainage of the glacier vanishes at once in the porous rocks to appear in springs in the distant valley and it is only in time of flood that the channel carries much water then there are several fine falls in the gorge feet or more in height tracing this wildchanging channel gorge gully or canyon the sections will show mount shasta as a huge palimp zest containing the records layer upon layer of strangely contrasted events in its fiery icy history regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit you pass through a belt of juniper woods called the seaters to sheeprock at the foot of the shasta pass here you strike the old immigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain mount bremer is the most noted stronghold of the sheep in the whole shasta region large flocks dwell here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain and every alarm while traveling with a company of hunters i saw about in one flock the mule deer are nearly as heavy their long massive ears give them a very striking appearance but neither the glorified woods on the one hand nor the lake on the other could it first hold the eye then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding and mysterious then darkness like death two or three miles farther on is the main stronghold of the motox held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack the ducks less wary kept their places merely swimming in and out through openings in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their wake they were broad rugged crevast cloudlike masses of downgrinding ice pouring forth streams of muddy water as measures of the work they are doing and sculpturing the rocks beneath them very unlike the long majestic glaciers of alaska that riverlike go winding down the valleys through the forests to the sea thus the shasta river issues from a large lakelike spring in shasta valley and about twothirds of the volume of the macleod gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base should the volume of the stream where you strike it seems small then you will know that you are above the spring if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pit river then you are below it and in either case have only to follow the river up or down until you come to it under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at a distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into foam a splenium epilobium huchera hazel dogwood and alder make a luxurious fringe and setting and the forests of douglas bruce along the banks are the finest i have ever seen in this tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels as the lifeblood of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes to their banks

3081/166546,when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case instantly they absorbed all my attention though i did not give them a direct look and continued to observe them only in the glass yes and a very respectable one the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower george notted the boys look quite awake enough if the father does not do they still insist that miss chelliner was the only person in the room with them at this time george have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable the boys look quite awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing i inquired of george with my eyes still on this fervent watcher i took quite a fancy to him why i am looking at him now just an everyday deductive but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough yes hes more career in all his movements what does he want i asked as soon as george had returned to my side he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me i am facized complacently he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was detective greiss a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these he gave up work some time ago i have been told my husband went on but evidently a great case still has its alignment for him the trail here must be a very blind one for them to call him in i wish we had not left so soon he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers however a little later we had a comfortable chat it was one which gave me a small triumph over george the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latters face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed this is very good of you he began glancing down at the aged detectives bundled up legs and gently pushing a chair towards him its the most inexplicable there but clues there are absolutely none that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can at least that is what we hope its a case in a thousand grise the old mans eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor she had no companion near her no word no cry just to collapse and sudden fall in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven what do you make of it grace i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell a young fellow who had been hovering in the background at one step forward he was the plainfaced detective who had spoken to george this sweet water as they called him was i have since understood one of his prodigies and more or less of a favorite been over the ground studied the affair carefully very well then youre in a position to pioneer me well well thats honest at all events but im in no position to make promises old days dont return for the asking whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below what are two of the musicians from the end of the hall naturally they reached her first mark sauerby and klaus hinnerberg honest germans men who have played here for years who came next on the scene some people from the lobby anybody before the father came in yes ms clark the middleaged lady with the parishes i suppose she has been carefully questioned very i should say and she speaks of no weapon not till the doctor came her doctor who was happily in his office in this very building yes mr slater the assistant manager who was in the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed no doubt sweetwater someone drew that weapon out not altogether by me wherever she pleases only i cant walk far it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place but theyll put a man on for you very good manage it as you will ill wait here till youre ready explain yourself to the lady tell her im an old and romantic invillet who has been used to asking his own questions as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweet water stole a glance at mr christ there was no doubting them in this instance yes for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery yes many times what made the difference miss clark started and her sweet face showed a moments perplexity did i she queried musingly no a very natural one i should say and the glance she cast him while not beating his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission i know she said what you are going to ask me now there was no point in the wound the time is narrowed down to one and in that one ms clark was the only person to touch her i will trouble you no further sweetwater help me out of this but vigor returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clark and turned to take the elevator the next minute she was in this ladys arms no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezzanine what follows she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her it did not fall

3170/137482,with an education which ought to have ensured me an honorable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a mans own conscious besides i was of opinion that a mans profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his wants and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants than those of officers in general are scandalous proceedings often exposed to the greatest danger we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes we did the same with physicians whom we often sent halfdressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought a great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the church wardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits in every one of the perishes of the city of venice there is a large public house called magazino yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way the waiter of the magazine came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due in joining silence under penalty of death we took our three prisoners to a large boat where is my husband never fear you shall see him again tomorrow my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature beat us goodnight thanking us all with perfect good faith two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of it went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had and hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour in drinking there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed i picked it up and coming up to him just to see what was going down the steps i hand it to him i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gandhalla saying that he would leave me at my house i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught resetta such a forcible lesson i inquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be blood again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me thinking i had the right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me will i thought it better to preserve a modest silence he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him the physician who attended him was named tarot he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying a micurial ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again he entreated me to tell him the truth what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i like to put i obeyed implicitly and met your exlency the three friends were astounded i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer they all ask me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith in whatever in that prediction they believe that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits and they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kindhearted to think them the work of the devil and ensued their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit there were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of screwpals as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undecieved them besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who having nothing else to do and always trying to find out the cause of every moral phenomena they mate with which their narrow intellect cannot understand whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gandola at your orders my own table in sequins a month you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your advisor and everything that may happen to you and everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude

up to the blissful holiday that had come at last nothing can surprise me now im prepared for anything even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a jick i feel like a boy out of school or rather a man out of prison and must enjoy my liberty in some way im not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it i dont want you two i love to see you so young and happy only you are not the old david and ive got to get acquainted with the new one i hope you like him better than the frostbitten old david you first knew and were kind enough to love mother says ive gone back to the time before we lost letti and i sometimes feel as if i had in that case you will find me a proud and petuous ambitious fellow christie at how will that suit excellent i like pride of your sort in petuosity becomes you for you have learned to control it if need be and the ambition is best of all i shall wait for time to show then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses and twine similar xreves how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to perform the part given them in life and death to know home in the land did the great trouble bring a more sudden change than the little cottage in the lane david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and to spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehension it is terrible and yet glorious david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ring in his voice that made their hearts answer with a prompt i i in spite of love or fear the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose than they must take our turn and try to do as well yes david sister in sweet heart answered bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to send good then it will take the garden in the greenhouse off my hands to sodom for a year or longer if i like hes a kind neighborly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully i knew you would go i saw you getting ready and i made up my mind to follow you will let me do it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kiss that silenced him you have something to tell me i see it in your face dear i must go next evening as mrs sterling sat alone in the twilight a tall man in army blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside it saying with the most unsoldurally choking the voice the loyal friends who fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much

perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the word good and stupid or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honor them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not share it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the original
