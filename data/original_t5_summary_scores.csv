1673/143396,a laudable regard for the honor of the first prasolite has countenst the belief the hope the wish that the ebionites or at least the nazarens were distinguished only by their opposite perseverance in the practice of the mosaic rights their churches have disappeared their books are obliterated their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith and the softness of their infant creed would be variously molded by the zeal or prudence of years yet the most charitable criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure and proper divinity of christ his progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom and after a painful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross he lived and died for the service of mankind but the life and death of socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause of religion and justice and although the stoic or the hero may disdain the humble virtues of jesus the tears which he shed over his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his humanity the son of a virgin generated by the ineffable operation of the holy spirit was a creature without example or resemblance superior in every attribute of mind and body to the children of adam nor could it seem strange or incredible that the first of these eons the logos or word of god of the same substance with the father should descend upon earth to deliver the human race from vice and error and to conduct them in the paths of life and immortality but the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent and even the depravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east many among the gentile presulites refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously absurd the humanity of christ he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies but the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the dosi who taught not that christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an impassable and incorruptible body a fetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity a child that could attain the stature of perfect madhood without deriving any nourishment from the ordinary sources might continue to exist without repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter in their eyes jesus of nazareth was a mere mortal the legitimate son of joseph and mary but he was the best and wisest of the human race selected as the worthy instruments to restore upon earth the worship of the true and supreme deity when the messiah was delivered into the hands of the jews the christ and immortal and impassable being for sook his earthly tabernacle flew back to the plerima or world of spirits and left the solitary jesus to suffer to complain and to expire but the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable and the fate of an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of corinthus the worthy friend of athanasius the worthy antagonist of julian he bravely wrestled with the aryans and polypheists and though he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the scriptures yet as the profound doctor had been terrified of his own rationalist a polinaris was heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse in explanation he acquiesced in the old distinction of the greek philosopher as between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life but instead of a temporary and occasional alliance they established and we seal embrace the substantial indesoluble and everlasting union of a perfect god with a perfect man of the second

him the state of things at his home she stopped with her hand on the latch of the wilsons door to still her beating heart and listened to the hushed quiet within she opened the door softly there sat mrs wilson in the old rockingchair with one sick deathlike boy lying on her knee crying without let or pause but softly gently as fearing to disturb the troubled gasping child while behind her old alice let her fastdropping tears fall down on the dead body of the other twin which she was laying out on a boardplaced on a sort of sofasati in the corner of the room over the child which yet breathed the father bent watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none is there any chance for the other one thank you but earnest as the father was in watching the yetliving he

sound or motion the happiness of that moment when her soft hands touched thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear dont jim please dont whispered she again believing that his silence was only another form of grief mary i almost loathed myself when i feel i would not give up this minute when my brothers lie dead and father and mother are in such trouble for all my life thats passed and gone and mary as she tried to release her hand you know what makes me feel so blessed he remained upstairs until after the early dawn showed mary that she need have no

crossed to him or else i speak just natural and thats too kind and tender by half but will he think before it there was something of keen practical shrewdness about her which contrasted very bewitchingly with the simple foolish unwirldly ideas she had picked up from the romances which miss simmons young ladies were in the habit of recommending to each other yes the old leaven infused years ago by her ontester fermented in her little bosom and perhaps saw the more for her fathers aversion to the rich and the gentle it was a comfort to her when scolded by miss simmons to think of

current bushes constituted the only varieties of fruit poor marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs there were also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers and

toil it could have been that had planted these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly bees too strange to say had thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives besides some farmhouse miles away this was a fountain set round with the rim of old mossy stones and paved in its bed with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic work of various colored pebbles it now contained only shanty claire his two wives and a solitary chicken it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict watchfulness to keep it pure these feathered people had existed too long in their distinct variety a fact of which the present representatives judging by the lugubrius deportment seemed to be aware they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched at chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls the distinguishing mark of the hens was the crest of lamentably scanty growth in these latter days but so oddly and wickedly analogous to hebsibus turbine that phoebe to the poignant distress of her conscience but inevitably was led to fancy a general resemblance between these followon bipeds and her respectable relative the chicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran with some show of liveliness to her feet while shantikler and the ladies of his household regarded her with queer sidelong glances and then croaked one to another as if communicating their sage opinions of her character so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the idea not merely that they were the descendants of a timehonored race but that they had existed in their individual capacity ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny he held a hoe in his hand and while phoebe was gone in quest of the crumbs had begun to busy

disagreeable idea i turn up the earth by a way of pastime it is like a bandage over ones eyes to come into it if you would permit me said the artist looking at phoebe i should like to try whether the degaro type can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face most of my likenesses do look unamiable but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the originals are so there is a wonderful insight in heavens broad and simple sunshine while we give it credit only for depicting the mirrorists surface it actually brings out the secret character with the truth that no painter would ever venture upon even could he detect it yet the original wears to common eyes a very different expression he exhibited at the garotite miniature in a morocco case tv merely glanced at it and gave it back i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet the sun as you see tells quite another story and will not be coped out of it after half a dozen patient attempts on my part here we have the man sly settle hard imperious and with all cold as ice look at that eye and yet if you could only see the benign smile of the original well i dont wish to see it anymore observe phoebe turning away her eyes it is certainly very like the old portrait if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard is there nothing wild in the eye continued wholegrave so earnestly that it embarrassed phoebe as did also the quiet freedom with which she presumed on their so recent acquaintance it is nonsense said

but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldnt be at all surprised to learn that all mary anns things have been already bought and perhaps some of them marked it is most delightful it might just as well be someone elses wedding so unimportant is the part which i am set to play in it for instance look at their behavior in the matter of the ring the accident and question occurred upon the sunday evening the girl is fretting but you dont seem to notice it i guessed positively guessed thats it on your account from a cousin of ours whos in that line i never saw people like the snowlings for possessing relatives and all sorts of lines i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mary anns engagement ring but i handed over the amount it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigstie for all i know when she heard of my engagement with mary ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstie and that i should pay her rent for it there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations it turned out that she had a little money of her own about pounds a year and of course i had my expectations and she had hers it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfully in fact i shall make popagiveme pounds at least a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush and it will be something to have by us i know what mama can afford to give and i will see if she gives it and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it wont be my fault if i dont get it of course there are some people with whom you cant be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can theres

2902/9006,one who writes of such an era labors under a troublesome disadvantage in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the churchs case far more weekly than the facts deserve not be it ever remembered that the slightest suspicion of immorality attaches either to the heroine of this book or to the leading philosophers of her school for several centuries that divine word who is the light who lighteth every man which comeeth into the world how to awaken in the heart of mankind a moral craving never before felt in any strength except by a few isolated philosophers or prophets the very emperors had to raid themselves on her side julians last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses had his death the great tide wave of new opinion rolled on unchecked and the rulers of earth were feigned to swim with the stream to accept in words at least the churchs laws as theirs to acknowledge a king of kings to whom even they owed homage and obedience and to call their own slaves their poor brethren and often too their spiritual superiors but if the emperor had become christian the empire had not in the meanwhile the minds of men cut adrift from their ancient moorings wandered wildly over pathless seas of speculative doubt and especially in the more metaphysical and contemplative east attempted to solve for themselves the questions of mans relation to the unseen by those thousand schisms heresies and theosophies it is a disgrace to the word philosophy to call them by it on the records of which the student now gazes bewildered unable alike to count or to explain their fantasies they brought before the minds of church men a thousand new questions which must be solved unless the church was to relinquish forever her claims as the great teacher and its had us fire of the human soul but the health of a church depends not merely on the creed which it professes not even on the wisdom and holiness of a few great ecclesiastics but on the faith and virtue of its individual members the mens santa must have a corpus santa to inhabit and the new blood at the era of the story was at hand tribe after tribe was crowding down to the alps and trampling upon each other on the frontiers of the empire the huns singly their inferior pressed them from behind with the irresistible weight of numbers italy with her rich cities and fertile lowlands beckoned them on to plunder as auxiliary they had learned their own strength and a roman weakness a causas belly was soon found how aniquitous was the conduct of the sons of theodosius in refusing the usual bounty by which the goths were bribed not to attack the empire the whole pentup dayluch burst over the plains of italy and the western empire became from that day th a dying idiot while the new invaders divided europe among themselves the countless treasures which five centuries of rapine had accumulated around the capital had become the prey of men clothed in sheep skins and horse hide and the sister of an emperor had found her beauty virtue and pride of race worthily matched by those of the hardhanded northern hero who led her away from italy as his captive and his bride to found new kingdoms in south france and spain and to drive the newlyarrived vandals across the straits of gibraltar into the thenblooming coastland of northern africa that extraordinary reform in morals which according to salvian and his contemporaries the vandal conquerors worked in north africa availed them nothing they lost more than they gave climate bad example and the luxury of power degraded them in one century into a race of helpless and debauched slaveholders doomed to utter extermination before the semigothic armies of belisarius and with them vanished the last chance that the gothic races would exercise on the eastern world the same stern yet wholesome discipline under which the western had been restored to life that wonderful metaphysics subtlety which in phrases and definitions too often unmeaning to our grosser intellect saw the

3000/15664,shaster rambles and modoc memories arctic beauty and desolation with their blessings and dangers all may be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warm fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers perhaps the profession of doing good may be full but everybody should be kind at least to himself go quietly alone no harm will befall you but it is far better to go a foot one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether as wood for fires is everywhere abundant only a little food will be required thus ones sulters on and on in the glorious radiance in utter peace and forgetfulness of time yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull looking when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable invitation as if not at home at such time its height seems much less as if crouching and weary it were taking rest every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital whirl and rush and though many feet and wings are folded how many are a stir slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a trip around the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath wellfetched trees that shed the rain like a roof then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of bird song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chaparral a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finally blended they seem a part of the night itself and make a deeper silence and setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a few miles you may see in approaching it its suspiciouslooking yellowspotted hood and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands as if you were approaching a dangerous snake it is lined with emerald algae and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting it is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about feet above sea level in moreane sprinkled ice cliffs feet high the long grey slopes leading up to the glacier seem remarkably smooth and unbroken most of the drainage of the glacier vanishes at once in the porous rocks to appear in springs in the distant valley and it is only in time of flood that the channel carries much water then there are several fine falls in the gorge feet or more in height tracing this wildchanging channel gorge gully or canyon the sections will show mount shasta as a huge palimp zest containing the records layer upon layer of strangely contrasted events in its fiery icy history regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit you pass through a belt of juniper woods called the seaters to sheeprock at the foot of the shasta pass here you strike the old immigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain mount bremer is the most noted stronghold of the sheep in the whole shasta region large flocks dwell here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain and every alarm while traveling with a company of hunters i saw about in one flock the mule deer are nearly as heavy their long massive ears give them a very striking appearance but neither the glorified woods on the one hand nor the lake on the other could it first hold the eye then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding and mysterious then darkness like death two or three miles farther on is the main stronghold of the motox held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack the ducks less wary kept their places merely swimming in and out through openings in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their wake they were broad rugged crevast cloudlike masses of downgrinding ice pouring forth streams of muddy water as measures of the work they are doing and sculpturing the rocks beneath them very unlike the long majestic glaciers of alaska that riverlike go winding down the valleys through the forests to the sea thus the shasta river issues from a large lakelike spring in shasta valley and about twothirds of the volume of the macleod gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base should the volume of the stream where you strike it seems small then you will know that you are above the spring if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pit river then you are below it and in either case have only to follow the river up or down until you come to it under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at a distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into foam a splenium epilobium huchera hazel dogwood and alder make a luxurious fringe and setting and the forests of douglas bruce along the banks are the finest i have ever seen in this tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels as the lifeblood of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes to their banks and not one dull passage is found in all their eventful histories tracing the maccloud to its highest springs and over the divide to the fountains of fall river near fort crook vents down that river to its confluence with the pit on from there to the volcanic region about lassens bute through the big meadows among the sources of the feather river and down through forests of sugar pine to the fertile plains of chico this is a glorious saunter and imposes no hardship the ascent of lassens bute is an easy walk and the views from the summit are extremely telling the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an hours walk from you though the distance in an airline is about miles the big meadows lie near the foot of lassens butte a beautiful spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forested mountains scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by tahoe the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and

3081/166546,when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case instantly they absorbed all my attention though i did not give them a direct look and continued to observe them only in the glass yes and a very respectable one the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower george notted the boys look quite awake enough if the father does not do they still insist that miss chelliner was the only person in the room with them at this time george have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable the boys look quite awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing i inquired of george with my eyes still on this fervent watcher i took quite a fancy to him why i am looking at him now just an everyday deductive but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough yes hes more career in all his movements what does he want i asked as soon as george had returned to my side he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me i am facized complacently he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was detective greiss a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these he gave up work some time ago i have been told my husband went on but evidently a great case still has its alignment for him the trail here must be a very blind one for them to call him in i wish we had not left so soon he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers however a little later we had a comfortable chat it was one which gave me a small triumph over george the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latters face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed this is very good of you he began glancing down at the aged detectives bundled up legs and gently pushing a chair towards him its the most inexplicable there but clues there are absolutely none that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can at least that is what we hope its a case in a thousand grise the old mans eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor she had no companion near her no word no cry just to collapse and sudden fall in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven what do you make of it grace i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell a young fellow who had been hovering in the background at one step forward he was the plainfaced detective who had spoken to george this sweet water as they called him was i have since understood one of his prodigies and more or less of a favorite been over the ground studied the affair carefully very well then youre in a position to pioneer me well well thats honest at all events but im in no position to make promises old days dont return for the asking whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below what are two of the musicians from the end of the hall naturally they reached her first mark sauerby and klaus hinnerberg honest germans men who have played here for years who came next on the scene some people from the lobby anybody before the father came in yes ms clark the middleaged lady with the parishes i suppose she has been carefully questioned very i should say and she speaks of no weapon not till the doctor came her doctor who was happily in his office in this very building yes mr slater the assistant manager who was in the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed no doubt sweetwater someone drew that weapon out not altogether by me wherever she pleases only i cant walk far it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place but theyll put a man on for you very good manage it as you will ill wait here till youre ready explain yourself to the lady tell her im an old and romantic invillet who has been used to asking his own questions as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweet water stole a glance at mr christ there was no doubting them in this instance yes for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery yes many times what made the difference miss clark started and her sweet face showed a moments perplexity did i she queried musingly no a very natural one i should say and the glance she cast him while not beating his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission i know she said what you are going to ask me now there was no point in the wound the time is narrowed down to one and in that one ms clark was the only person to touch her i will trouble you no further sweetwater help me out of this but vigor returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clark and turned to take the elevator the next minute she was in this ladys arms no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezzanine what follows she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her it did not fall

3170/137482,with an education which ought to have ensured me an honorable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a mans own conscious besides i was of opinion that a mans profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his wants and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants than those of officers in general are scandalous proceedings often exposed to the greatest danger we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes we did the same with physicians whom we often sent halfdressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought a great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the church wardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits in every one of the perishes of the city of venice there is a large public house called magazino yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way the waiter of the magazine came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due in joining silence under penalty of death we took our three prisoners to a large boat where is my husband never fear you shall see him again tomorrow my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature beat us goodnight thanking us all with perfect good faith two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of it went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had and hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour in drinking there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed i picked it up and coming up to him just to see what was going down the steps i hand it to him i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gandhalla saying that he would leave me at my house i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught resetta such a forcible lesson i inquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be blood again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me thinking i had the right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me will i thought it better to preserve a modest silence he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him the physician who attended him was named tarot he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying a micurial ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again he entreated me to tell him the truth what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i like to put i obeyed implicitly and met your exlency the three friends were astounded i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer they all ask me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith in whatever in that prediction they believe that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits and they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kindhearted to think them the work of the devil and ensued their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit there were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of screwpals as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undecieved them besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who having nothing else to do and always trying to find out the cause of every moral phenomena they mate with which their narrow intellect cannot understand whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gandola at your orders my own table in sequins a month you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your advisor and everything that may happen to you and everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude

fredericks jealousy was excited and the tortures he suffered in consequence convinced him beyond a doubt of the sincerity of his affection every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as here to for he pleaded his cause with such ardor that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success yet did the watchful miss whitley oftentimes hear a si escape from her unknown to herself till she was reminded of it and then a sudden blush would instantly overspread her face night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad morning after morning it had been broken by the clamor of her return i hope miss melner you passed this evening at home i thought miss milner you gave me your word that you would pass this evening at home yes indeed and i believe it is right that i should keep my first promise is it not mrs horton rose from her seat moved the decantars and fruit round the table stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered nor had this good womans efficious labor has taken the least from the awkwardness of the silence which as soon as the bustle she had made was over returned in its full force miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door her hand fell motionless from that which she held she appeared motionless herself till mrs horton besieging her not to be uneasy at the treatment she had received made her tears flow as if her heart was breaking it was not from any real cause of grief that she wept but there was a magnetic quality in tears which always attracted hers do you think i would go answered miss milner with an eagerness that for a time suppressed her tears in contradiction to his will if you think so madam i see nothing that should prevent me now nice i command you not to stir out of the room this evening miss woodley obediently sat down and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber of her friend she never marked by one impertinent word or by one line of her face the restraint she suffered at the usual hour mr doraphorth and his ward were summoned to tea he entered with accountonance which evinced the remains of anger his eye gave testimony of his absent thoughts and though he took up a pamphlet affecting to read it was plain to discern that he scarcely knew he held it in his hand miss woodley thought it her duty to be mute and now the jingle of a teaspoon was like a deeptoned bell all was so quiet mrs horton too in the selfapproving reflection that she was not in a quarrel or altercation of any kind felt herself at this moment remarkably peaceful and charitable

it difficult sometimes read and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner doraforth read on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned after a few minutes pause and some little embarrassment on the part of mrs horton at the disappointment she had to encounter

clerical brother with horror the reverend meacon was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties smoked clay pipes chewed tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers so they went onto the

3853/163249,her meeting with ledi was indescribably tender and the days that followed were pretty equally divided between her and her brother in nursing the one and loving the other but even while she enjoyed every hour of life and begrudged the time given to sleep she felt as if the dream was too beautiful to last and often said so christi turned a deaf ear to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last nothing can surprise me now im prepared for anything even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a jick i feel like a boy out of school or rather a man out of prison and must enjoy my liberty in some way im not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it i dont want you two i love to see you so young and happy only you are not the old david and ive got to get acquainted with the new one i hope you like him better than the frostbitten old david you first knew and were kind enough to love mother says ive gone back to the time before we lost letti and i sometimes feel as if i had in that case you will find me a proud and petuous ambitious fellow christie at how will that suit excellent i like pride of your sort in petuosity becomes you for you have learned to control it if need be and the ambition is best of all i shall wait for time to show then they went back to their work little dreaming as they tied roses and twine similar xreves how near that other chance was how soon they were to be called upon to keep their promise and how well each was to perform the part given them in life and death to know home in the land did the great trouble bring a more sudden change than the little cottage in the lane david was sober enough now and went about his work with a grim set to his lips and to spark in his eyes that made the three women look at one another pale with unspoken apprehension it is terrible and yet glorious david held it close in both of his saying gratefully thank you mother then fixing his eyes on the younger yet not dearer women he added with a ring in his voice that made their hearts answer with a prompt i i in spite of love or fear the boys bless their brave hearts have done nobly but older men are needed now we cannot sacrifice all the gallant lads and we who have more to lose than they must take our turn and try to do as well yes david sister in sweet heart answered bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to send good then it will take the garden in the greenhouse off my hands to sodom for a year or longer if i like hes a kind neighborly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully i knew you would go i saw you getting ready and i made up my mind to follow you will let me do it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kiss that silenced him you have something to tell me i see it in your face dear i must go next evening as mrs sterling sat alone in the twilight a tall man in army blue entered quietly stood watching the tranquil figure for a moment then went and knelt down beside it saying with the most unsoldurally choking the voice the loyal friends who fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country it would have taken many napsacks to hold all the gifts showered upon him by his friends and neighbors finding that leisha showed little enthusiasm on the subject she tried to rouse him by patriotic appeals of various sorts very well said mrs wilkins resolutely to herself if i cant make no impression on his soul i will on his stomach and see how thatll work we cant afford no nice fiddles now when our men are suffering so he was not as unmoved as he seemed by the general excitement and had felt sundry manly impulses to up and at him when his comrades in the shop discussed the crisis with ironfold brandishing of alls and vengeful pounding of soul leather as if the rebels were under the hammer to say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bait hook and all but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that longsuffering man can you remember what hepsy told us and call them poor long suffering creators names no he aint its a trainer added and lizzy now cynthia be you satisfied and the inconsistent woman fell upon his butney breast weeping copiously his wife said him with the fat of the land regardless of consequences his children revolved about him with tireless curiosity and wonder his neighbors flocked into a plot advise and admire every one treated him with respect most grateful to his feelings he was an object of interest and with every hour his importance increased so that by night he felt like a commander in chief and bore himself accordingly then the goods saw openly shorted the boat and she had born so long in secret and bravely treged on alone the women dropped their work to look and listen for his visits were few and short and every instant was precious they knew what it was without a word mrs sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head now lets be brave and enjoy every minute of it we will what can i do for your davy asked christy wonderfully supported by the thought that she was going to as a married woman you will get on better as my wife you will be allowed to come to me if i need you and as my he stopped here for he could not add as my widow you will have my pension to support you nothing can part us anymore not even death for love like ours will last forever not one david thats true love christy then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will buy and buy and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over david caught the exaltation and gave no further thought to anything but the duty of the hour finding himself stronger and braver for that long look into the illuminated face of the woman he loved the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first twerk i did with david was arranging flowers like these for a dead babys little coffin but i think few broad stress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose this overwedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from a halfpacked trunk her new hospital suit of soft grey wool and stuff mr powers waiting are you ready love quite ready you young folks take a wedding trip to the greenhouse while we see how well we can get on without you david and christy went smiling away together and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorn the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts embedded in any speech her song was lettys broken whisper as she folded her arms around davids empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us all watched with quickened breath and proud souls that living waves blew below and bright with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street in a way to join the sea of dontless hearts that for months had rolled up against the south and ebbed back retained with

422/122949,every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some form or other the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling cast pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised he honors whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals selfglorification probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the word good and stupid or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honor them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not share it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the original noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ample and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto been victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendor the individual dares to be individual and attach himself at this turning point of history there manifest themselves side by side and often mixed and entangled together a magnificent manifold virginforestlike upgrowth and upstriving a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth and an extraordinary decay and selfdestruction owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms which strive with one another for sun and light and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality nothing but new wise nothing but new howls no common formulas any longer misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the conucopias of good and bad a portentious simultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still exhausted still unwirried corruption danger is again present the mother of morality great danger this time shifted into the individual into the neighbor and friend into the street into their own child into their own heart into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach this is the problem of race in our very democratic or rather very plebeian age education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitraryness therein but rather there is something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations even when they use the same language or rather when people have lived long together under similar conditions of climate soil danger requirement toil their originates their from and entity that understands itself namely a nation the greater the danger the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed within intercourse also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things a mans estimates of value betray something of the structure of his soul and wherein it sees its conditions of life its intrinsic needs profound suffering makes noble it separates one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takes suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound the highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation as a saint for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question occasionally to the waking call comes too late the chance which gives permission to take action when their best youth and strength for action have been used up in sitting still and how many of one just as he sprang up has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy and whoever thou art what is it that now pleases thee only name it whatever i have i ask for thee but you must understand him when you complain about it there must be a sort of repuglance in me to believe anything definite about myself is there perhaps some enigma therein probably but fortunately nothing from my own teeth perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to myself as it is sufficiently agreeable to me but what has happened to you i do not know he said as attatingly perhaps the harpies have flown over my table to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul and only seldom finds his tableaid and his food prepared the danger will always be great nowadays however it is extraordinarily so and to choose for company that rogus and cheerful vice

652/130726,san franciscos carefree spirit was fully exemplified before the ashes of the great fire of were cold thompson opened a large restaurant in oferrall street just above fillmore and for two years or more did a thriving business his place being noted for its good cooking and its splendid service one of his waiters phil tyson was one of the earlier ones to go back into the byrne district to begin business and he opened a restaurant called the del monte in powell street near market but it was too early for success and closed after a short career here as well as in a number of other places one can well appreciate the colloquial definition of cabaret here there is always good music and food well cooked and well served and always a lively crowd during the luncheon dinner and after theater hours the room is not large but its dimensions are greatly magnified owing to the covering of mirrors which line the walls this garish display of mirrors and elaborate decoration of ceiling and pillars gives it the appearance of the abode of saturnalia but decorum is the rule among the patrons john tate is the presiding spirit here he having made reputation as club manager and then as manager of the cliff house the poodle dog has a hotel attachment where one may get rooms or full apartments if you know how to order and do not care to count the cost when you order probably the best dinner at these restaurants can be had at either blancos or the poodle dog the cuisine is of the best and the chefs rank at the top of their art at the two mentioned one pays for the surroundings as well as for the food and sometimes this is worth paying for the restaurants of the present day that approach nearest the old bohemian restaurants of prefire days of the french class are jacks in sacramento street between montgomery and kearney felix in montgomery street between clay and washington and the poodle dog bergas franks in bush street between kearney and grant avenue in either of these restaurants you will be served with the best the market affords cooked the right way in this same district is the mint in commercial street between montgomery and kierney streets it has changed from what it was in the old days but is still an excellent place to dine it is an idea that is worthwhile but unfortunately the proprietors depend too much on the decorative feature and too little on the food and how they serve it the flytrap and charlies fashion the first in sutter street near keirney and the other in market near sutter serve wellcooked foods especially soup salads and fish of course these are not the entire menus but of all the wellprepared dishes these are their best both serve good spanish dinners at reasonable prices his prices are moderate and his cooking in vions of the best and will satisfy the most critical of the gourmets at the corner of market in eddie streets is the odin down in a basement with decorations of most garish order one can almost imagine himself

and cook for half an hour basting frequently with the original brine when done take the meat out of the sauce strain the sauce through a fine colander and add a few raisins a piece of honey cake or ginger snaps and the meat of one fresh tomato season with salt and pepper and a little sugar to taste the hofbrow however is less distinctively german as the greater number of its patrons are

his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint but more like a bend in a dummys limb thrown over the back of a chair he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate

morbid murderer summoning all his remaining strength for a last stab his enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger the old terrace turns slowly his head on a skinny neck

still downstairs he looks dubiously at his brotherinlaw but he did not ask him for information mr verlock perceived with some surprise that he did not know really what to say to stevie he stood still in the middle of the parlor and looked into the kitchen in silence he watched him just circulate a murmuring in the kitchen steep you proud around the table like an excited animal in a cage the light thrown down by the shade fell dazzlingly on the white pillow sunk by the weight of her head reposing with closed eyes and dark hair done up in several plates for the night her bare feet as if poked through the bottom of an unadorned sleeved calical sack button tightly at neck and wrists felt over the rug for the slippers while she looked upward into her husbands face there is no occupation that fails a man more completely than that of a secret agent of police its like your horse suddenly falling dead under you in the midst of an uninhabited and thirsty plane the comparison occurred to mr

pause which lasted for three ticks of the clock this dread led him to make the remark that stevie had disregarded his suggestion to go to bed there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head mr verlox and zioides had prevented him from attaching any sense to what his wife was saying that boy hears too much of what is talked about here if i had known they were coming tonight i would have seen to it that he went to bed at the same time i did he was out of his mind with something he overheard about eating peoples flesh and drinking blood whats the good of talking like that mr verluck was fully responsive now as karl junt he grouts savagely hes fit to hear what said here he believes its all true he knows no better he gets into his passions over it he glared at me as if he didnt know who i was when he went downstairs i wish he had never been
