He questions whether Sir Frederick Layton's work is truly Greek, and finds little of Homer's Ithaca in it. He also critiques Lynelle's pictures, Mason's titles, and Birkett's landscapes, comparing them to Mr. Carker's smile and Mr. Collier's slap on the back.

Quilter argues that painting is a different quality from mathematics, and that finish in art is adding more factors. He laments the divorce between decorative art and what we typically call pictures, and reminds us that in the great days of art, Michelangelo was a master of both furnishing and ornamentation. Quilter is severe on Ruskin for not recognizing that a picture should depict human frailty, but notes that many phases of feeling are missing from his own work.

Quilter's writing is lucid and expressive, but his own work, ""The Tupper of Painting,"" has failed to impress. Despite this, his criticisms of other artists are insightful and well-written, making him a notable figure in the art world.","Mr. Quilter, an apostle of the middle class, shares his thoughts on art, critiquing Sir Frederick Layton's work, Lynelle's paintings, and Mason's etchings.

depravity of matter infected the primitive churches of the east many among the gentile presulites refused to believe that a celestial spirit an undivided portion of the first essence had been personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh and in their zeal for the divinity they piously absurd the humanity of christ he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of omnipotence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies but the rashness of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those of the dosi who taught not that christ was a phantom but that he was clothed with an impassable and incorruptible body a fetus that could increase from an invisible point to its full maturity a child that could attain the stature of perfect madhood without deriving any nourishment

distinguished by their adherence to Mosaic law. However, their churches and writings have largely disappeared, leaving behind only fragments of their beliefs. The life and death of Jesus Christ, on the other hand, are well-documented and have been the subject of much debate and controversy. Some believed that Jesus was a phantom or a mere mortal, while others saw him as a divine being who was personally united with a human body. The Dosi, a group of early Christian theologians, believed that Jesus was a mortal man who was chosen by God to restore the worship of the true deity. They argued that Jesus' humanity was not diminished by his divinity, but rather was elevated by it. The fate of Jesus, who was abandoned by his divine companion and left to suffer and die on the cross, has been the subject of much speculation and debate. Some have seen his death as a sacrifice for humanity's sins, while others have viewed it as a tragic event that was unnecessary and unjust. Despite these differences, the life and death of Jesus Christ remain a central theme in Christian theology and continue to be the subject of much study and reflection.","The Ebionites and Nazarenes, considered heretical by some, believed Jesus was a mortal man, while others, like the Docetists, thought he was a phantom or a divine being without a human body. The Docetists argued that Jesus' humanity was an illusion, created by God to deceive others, while others believed he was a mortal man, the son of Joseph and Mary, who was chosen by God to restore the true worship of the deity. The sectaries, including the Arians and Polypeists, debated the nature of Jesus, with some arguing for a temporary union of the divine and human, while others believed in a permanent and indissoluble union. The debate was fueled by the prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent depravity of matter, which led to a rejection of the idea of a divine being uniting with human flesh. The controversy continued, with some sectaries, like the Docetists, arguing that Jesus was a mere mortal, while others, like the Arians, believed he was a divine being who abandoned his human form to suffer and die. The debate was further complicated by the distinction between the rational and sensitive soul of man, which led to different interpretations of the nature of Jesus' humanity and divinity.","The Ebionites and Nazarenes, early Christian sects, debated the nature of Jesus Christ, with some believing him to be a mortal man and others considering him a divine being, while others proposed a middle ground, such as the Logos theory, which posited a union of God and man in Jesus.",4,3,4,4,"The summary is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear and concise presentation of the main points.

The patriarch, with a seditious mob, attacked synagogues, causing innocent people to be confused with guilty ones, and Alexandria was impoverished. The prefect of Egypt, Oresti, complained about the persecution, but his complaints were quickly forgotten by the ministers of Theodosius and deeply remembered by a priest who pretended to pardon him while continuing to hate him.

The prefect of Egypt, with the support of the Vatican, invaded the provinces of Antioch and Alexandria, and the metropolitan of Europe and Asia was forced to flee. The churches were shut against those who defended Nistorius, and a strong garrison was stationed in the cathedral. The emperor tried various methods to reconcile the theological quarrel, but ultimately, Nistorius was left to face his enemies alone.

As the danger to the church grew, the orthodox chiefs were forced to prioritize their duty to protect the faith over their personal vows. Nistorius was eventually released from prison by a wandering tribe of Nubians, who dismissed their captives but refused to take him with them. He longed to escape the Roman and orthodox city to join the savages.","Carol, the patriarch, began his reign by persecuting innocent sectaries in Alexandria, destroying a wealthy colony. His zeal exposed him to the Julian law's penalties, but he was secure in a feeble government and superstitious age. Meanwhile, Nostoreus, the metropolitan of Europe and Asia, was accused of hindering the prefect's reconciliation with the archbishop and was removed. This led to the invasion of Antioch and Alexandria, dividing the churches. The emperor tried to reconcile the theological quarrel, but Nostoreus was eventually superseded by a higher duty.

The family was impressed by Mrs. Shamir's warm hospitality, and her children, Ambrose and Antonia, were particularly friendly. Antonia, with her dark skin and glowing cheeks, seemed unusual, and the family was drawn to her. As they explored the new home, they noticed the father's unusual appearance, with his long ears and well-shaped hands. The wind was strong, and the family had to hold onto their hats and skirts.

Antonia pointed to a gold cottonwood tree and seemed eager to communicate something. She repeated a phrase several times, and then wanted to give the narrator a small silver ring.

In contrast, those in democratic societies, such as the United States, are more serious and focused on their individual pursuits. This seriousness is partly due to pride, which is more prevalent in democratic nations. In these societies, individuals are often occupied with government affairs or acquiring private fortunes, and their minds are complex, embracing multiple objects simultaneously.

The national vanity of Americans is more restless and captious than that of the English. Americans are impatient with small compliments and crave insatiable praise. In aristocratic countries, the great possess immense privileges, which they rely on, without seeking to acquire smaller advantages. They are calm and assured of their superiority, unmoved by the desire to show off or prove themselves. In aristocratic societies, national pride assumes a reserved, indifferent, and haughty form, which is imitated by other classes. In contrast, those in democratic societies display the same petty jealousies, eagerness for small advantages, and desire to parade their possessions as those in aristocratic societies.","In aristocratic societies, people indulge in lavish displays of wealth and status, whereas in democratic communities, individuals are more focused on their personal fortunes and government affairs. Americans, in particular, are driven by a restless national vanity, seeking constant praise and admiration. Unlike aristocratic nations, where pride is rooted in inherited privileges, American pride stems from their democratic system and the pursuit of individual success. This leads to a sense of insecurity and a need to constantly prove themselves, whereas aristocratic nations are content with their established superiority and do not feel the need to flaunt their advantages. The same is true for the classes within these societies, where individuals display the same jealousies and competitive tendencies as those in democratic communities.","The national pride of Americans is more restless and captious than that of the English, driven by an insatiable desire for praise and a tendency to be overly sensitive to criticism, whereas aristocratic societies tend to be more reserved and indifferent in their displays of pride.",4,4,4,4,"The summary effectively conveys the main points of the original text, with a good balance of clarity and concision.

The ancestors of the present pretender, Kongel, had a close relationship with the licentious bards and the powerful Order of Tara, which fueled his ambition. The last rally of Druidism against Christianity took place on the Plain of Moira, where the poets of succeeding ages detailed the events of that memorable day. The royal brothers, who jointly ruled, fell victims to an epidemic, and the only conflicts that occurred on Irish soil were with Pictish or Anglo-Saxon forces.

The Saxons of Kent and southern kingdoms were converted by missionaries from France, Rome, or native preachers of the first or second Christian generation. The missionaries taught that reducing Christians to slavery was inconsistent with the gospel, and the liberated exiles rejoiced on the Plain of Meef. The Abbott of Iona pitched his tent on the Plain of Tara, indicating that the edifices that once made a fine show in the days of Patrick were ruined and uninhabitable.

The holy prelate of Ferns met Kongel and related a vision in which he was instructed to demand the abolition of the impost, a tribute that was enormous. The head of cattle annually paid as tribute was a significant burden, and the assembly in such a place at such a period was natural. The Saxons of Northumbria recognized their apostles, St. Aidan and St. Cuthbert, as the name implies, embracing nearly all the country from the Humber to the Pictish border. The monastery on the barren rock, about three miles in length, was covered with monastic buildings and its cemetery was already adorned with the tombs of saints and kings.","Throughout the century, the Church's power grew, influencing significant changes. The ancestors of the Pretender, Kongel, received the licentious bards and used their popularity to fuel his ambition. The last Druidic rally against Christianity took place under his banner, where the royal brothers fell victim to an epidemic. Meanwhile, missionaries from France, Rome, and native preachers converted various kingdoms, including Northumbria, where St. Aidan and St. Cuthbert were apostles. The Church's teachings emphasized the inconsistency of reducing Christians to slavery, and the liberated exiles rejoiced at the abolition of the enormous tribute. The holy prelate of Ferns met with Kongel, relating a vision that instructed him to demand the abolition of the impost. The missionaries' efforts led to the conversion of many kingdoms, including Kent and the southern kingdoms, which were influenced by missionaries from France or Rome. The Saxons of Northumbria recognized their apostles, St. Aidan and St. Cuthbert, and the barren rock, now covered with monastic buildings, became a hub of Christian activity.","The power of the church increased throughout the century, with the ancestors of the pretender Kongel receiving the licentious bards and the last rally of Druidism against Christianity taking place under his banner, leading to the conversion of various kingdoms and the establishment of monasteries and saints.",4,4,4,4,"The summary is well-structured and easy to follow, with a good balance of key points from the original text.

The author is cautious not to offend by taking liberties with private property, such as laying out a street that infringes upon someone's rights or building a house on unclaimed land. They also avoid using materials that are too grand or luxurious, opting instead for something more humble and practical. The author's goal is to create a story that is grounded in reality, rather than one that is overly ambitious or pretentious.","The author acknowledges that the narrative's humble texture makes it challenging to weave a moral into the story, and thus, he has not attempted to do so.

wonderful insight in heavens broad and simple sunshine while we give it credit only for depicting the mirrorists surface it actually brings out the secret character with the truth that no painter

small area surrounded by wooden fences and outbuildings. The white double rose bush had been propped up, and the pear tree and damson trees showed signs of recent pruning. Summer squashes, string beans, and tomatoes grew in the area, suggesting that someone had carefully tended the soil. Phoebe wondered who had planted the vegetables and kept the soil so clean.

As she explored the area, Phoebe came across a fountain, now empty, surrounded by old mossy stones and a mosaic of colored pebbles. Nearby, she found a coop containing a solitary chicken, two wives, and a hen. The fowl's crest was sparse, and Phoebe noticed a resemblance between them and her relative, the chicken. The fowl's wise and antique appearance made her think they had existed since the house was founded.

Phoebe met a man, likely the daguerreotypist, who was busy with his hoe. He asked her to sit for a portrait, claiming that his daguerreotype could reveal her true character. Phoebe was hesitant, but the man showed her a miniature portrait in a morocco case, which she barely glanced at before returning it. The man claimed that the portrait was modern and would reveal her true nature. Phoebe turned away, feeling embarrassed by the man's earnestness and quiet freedom in their conversation. She suggested that he ask her cousin, Hebsiva, to show him the portrait, as she did not want to discuss it further. The man left, and Phoebe went to bed, feeling restless.

I was delighted with the country's grandeur and the quiet, breeding sheep that roamed freely. With only a few hundred sheep, it was easy to keep track of them, and I soon became accustomed to spotting missing ones. The life was monotonous but healthy, and I didn't mind the solitude.

I was initially concerned about being an object of curiosity or dislike, but my guides were well-known and the villagers' natural politeness prevented any inconvenience. The streets were narrow and unpaved, but surprisingly clean, with vines growing outside many houses. Some houses had signboards with a bottle and glass, which made me feel at home.

The people were strikingly beautiful, with perfect features, and their expressions were divine. Even the elderly women at their cottage doors had a dignity and majesty of their own. The men were handsome, and the women beautiful, with a compound of Egyptian, Greek, and Italian features. The children were numerous and merry, and I expressed my admiration to my guides, who were pleased.

After passing several villages, we arrived at a considerable town, where my guides attempted to communicate with me. I gathered that I was in no danger, and was taken before the chief magistrate, who ordered me to be placed in an apartment with two other people. One of them was clearly unwell, coughing violently, while the other looked pale and ill, but was self-contained. They examined me, checking my pulse, tongue, and chest, and seemed pleased with my health.

As they searched my pockets, they found my watch, which I had forgotten, and were intrigued by its design. This seemed to calm the chief, who began to speak to me in a kinder manner. The encounter had a soothing effect, and I felt more at ease.","As we walked through the misty village, I was initially concerned about being gawked at, but my guides' familiarity with the locals put me at ease.

Christian Church, as the sins of the heathen world against which it fought were ""utterly indescribable."" The Church's case is thus presented more strongly than the facts deserve, and the author must navigate the delicate balance between decency and accuracy. The text highlights the Church's struggle to maintain its influence as the Roman Empire declined and new invaders, such as the Huns and Vandals, threatened its power.

The author notes that the Church's health depends not only on its creed and leaders but also on the faith and virtue of its individual members. The era saw the rise of new philosophical and theological movements, including schisms, heresies, and theosophies, which posed a significant challenge to the Church's authority. The text also describes the tumultuous events of the time, including the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the rise of new kingdoms in Europe and North Africa.

The author references various historical figures, including Julian, the Emperor Theodosius, and the Vandal conquerors, and highlights the impact of their actions on the course of history. The text also touches on the themes of morality, spirituality, and the struggle for power, as well as the complex and often contradictory nature of human nature. Throughout the text, the author acknowledges the limitations of their knowledge and the potential for anachronisms and errors.","The Christian Church faced a significant disadvantage in defending its actions against the heathen world, as the latter's sins were often indescribable and the Church's apologists were compelled to downplay the facts for decency's sake. The Church's claims as the great teacher and guide of humanity were challenged by the rise of new philosophical and metaphysical ideas, particularly in the East, which led to numerous schisms and heresies. Meanwhile, the Western Roman Empire was crumbling, and the Church's influence was being eroded by the influx of new invaders, including the Huns, Goths, and Vandals. As the Church struggled to maintain its authority, it was also grappling with the rise of new moral and philosophical ideas that threatened its teachings and the very fabric of society.","The decline of the Western Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity in the 5th century were marked by the influx of barbarian tribes, the collapse of the empire, and the spread of new philosophies and heresies, leading to a tumultuous era of spiritual and moral upheaval.",4,4,4,4,"The summary provides a clear and concise overview of the original text, capturing its main themes and ideas.

Pelagia spoke of the eternal and immortal, saying that even those who have cast off the masses can still be welcomed into the heroic ranks and rise to the gods. She expressed a desire to live without food and imitate the immortal gods, but acknowledged that this was not possible. She offered her companion fruit and bread, but seemed to despise the idea of being content with mere humanity.

The woman's companion, seemingly unaffected by Pelagia's words, entered the room, and Pelagia's tone changed, though she maintained her lofty impassibility.

than climbing the mountain is going around its warm fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers perhaps the profession of doing good may be full but everybody should be kind at least to himself go quietly alone no harm will befall you but it is far better to go a foot one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether

and wings are folded how many are a stir slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a trip around the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath wellfetched trees that shed the rain like a roof then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of bird song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chaparral a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finally blended they seem a part of the night itself and make a deeper silence and setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a

the forests to the sea thus the shasta river issues from a large lakelike spring in shasta valley and about twothirds of the volume of the macleod gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base should the volume of the stream where you strike it seems small then you will know that you are above the spring if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pit river then you are below it and in either case have only to follow the river up or down until you come to it under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at a distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and colors the

3081/166546,when we took our seats at the breakfast table it was with the feeling of being no longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case instantly they absorbed all my attention though i did not give them a direct look and continued to observe them only in the glass yes and a very respectable one the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt the boys belong to the gentleman who is a widower george notted the boys look quite awake enough if the father does not do they still insist that miss chelliner was the only person in the room with them at this time george have you ever thought that she might have been a suicide i know it sounds foolish but the alternative is so improbable the boys look quite awake enough but who can tell i would sooner believe that a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing i inquired of george with my eyes still on this fervent watcher i took quite a fancy to him why i am looking at him now just an everyday deductive but ambitious i suppose and quite alive to the importance of being thorough yes hes more career in all his movements what does he want i asked as soon as george had returned to my side he wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me i am facized complacently he appeared to know for he told me at once that he was detective greiss a man who had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these he gave up work some time ago i have been told my husband went on but evidently a great case still has its alignment for him the trail here must be a very blind one for them to call him in i wish we had not left so soon he was late of course but when he did appear i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers however a little later we had a comfortable chat it was one which gave me a small triumph over george the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it their greeting was cordial and the lines on the latters face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed this is very good of you he began glancing down at the aged detectives bundled up legs and gently pushing a chair towards him its the most inexplicable there but clues there are absolutely none that is we have not been able to find any perhaps you can at least that is what we hope its a case in a thousand grise the old mans eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor she had no companion near her no word no cry just to collapse and sudden fall in olden days they would have said struck by a bolt from heaven what do you make of it grace i should like to see the desk you speak of and the spot where she fell a young fellow who had been hovering in the background at one step forward he was the plainfaced detective who had spoken to george this sweet water as they called him was i have since understood one of his prodigies and more or less of a favorite been over the ground studied the affair carefully very well then youre in a position to pioneer me well well thats honest at all events but im in no position to make promises old days dont return for the asking whether he got anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank into a chair by one of the openings and looked down on the lobby below what are two of the musicians from the end of the hall naturally they reached her first mark sauerby and klaus hinnerberg honest germans men who have played here for years who came next on the scene some people from the lobby anybody before the father came in yes ms clark the middleaged lady with the parishes i suppose she has been carefully questioned very i should say and she speaks of no weapon not till the doctor came her doctor who was happily in his office in this very building yes mr slater the assistant manager who was in the lobby at the time says that ten minutes at least must have elapsed no doubt sweetwater someone drew that weapon out not altogether by me wherever she pleases only i cant walk far it has not been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time hustling to get a glimpse of this place but theyll put a man on for you very good manage it as you will ill wait here till youre ready explain yourself to the lady tell her im an old and romantic invillet who has been used to asking his own questions as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweet water stole a glance at mr christ there was no doubting them in this instance yes for some little time that is it seemed long though i believe it was not more than a minute before two men came running from the musicians gallery yes many times what made the difference miss clark started and her sweet face showed a moments perplexity did i she queried musingly no a very natural one i should say and the glance she cast him while not beating his eye showed that she understood the importance of the admission i know she said what you are going to ask me now there was no point in the wound the time is narrowed down to one and in that one ms clark was the only person to touch her i will trouble you no further sweetwater help me out of this but vigor returned to him before he had well reached the door and he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked miss clark and turned to take the elevator the next minute she was in this ladys arms no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezzanine what follows she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her it did not fall

respectable gentleman and his aunt, who were not the boys' parents, but rather the aunt of the boys, whose father was a widower. George and I discussed the case, and I asked him if he thought Miss Chelliner could have been a suicide. George suggested that the boys might have been mistaken, and that someone could have been watching from the corridor. I noticed a detective, Detective Greiss, who was old and experienced in solving baffling cases. He was called in to help with the investigation, which was proving to be a challenging one.

Detective Greiss examined the scene and questioned the witnesses, including Ms. Clark, who was a middle-aged lady who had been in the lobby at the time of the incident. He also spoke to the musicians, Mark Sauberby and Klaus Hinnerberg, who were among the first to arrive on the scene. The detective concluded that the weapon used in the crime was not found on or near the victim, and that it was likely that the perpetrator was someone who was familiar with the area. He also suggested that the victim may have been someone who was familiar with the area, as the weapon was not found in the usual places.

As the investigation continued, Detective Greiss and his team discovered that the victim had been alone in the mezzanine when she was struck, and that there was no sign of forced entry or struggle. The detective concluded that the victim had likely struck herself with the weapon, and that the strength of purpose that led her to do so gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her. The weapon was found in the lobby, and it was likely that it was thrown from the mezzanine. The case was a puzzling one, and it was unclear what had led the victim to take her own life.","Detective Grise, a seasoned investigator, arrived at the scene of a mysterious case, where a woman had fallen to her death. The police were baffled, with no clues or leads. Grise was called in to help, and he began questioning the witnesses, including George, who had been with the woman earlier. The detective's keen instincts and experience led him to suspect that the woman may have been a suicide, and he discovered that she had been alone in the room when she fell. As he investigated further, he found that the woman, Ms. Clark, had been questioned by the police, but she had not mentioned a weapon. Grise's theory was that Ms. Clark had taken her own life, and he found evidence to support this, including the fact that she was the only person who had touched her in the time leading up to her death. The case was solved, with Grise's expertise and experience proving crucial in uncovering the truth.","Detective Grise, a renowned expert in solving baffling cases, is called in to investigate the mysterious death of a woman, whose body was found with no signs of struggle or weapon, and the only clue is a faint trail of blood leading to a desk and a spot where she fell.",4,4,4,4,"The summary is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear and concise language.

3170/137482,with an education which ought to have ensured me an honorable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a mans own conscious besides i was of opinion that a mans profession whatever it might be ought to supply him with enough money to satisfy all his wants and the very poor pay of an officer would never have been sufficient to cover my expenses because my education had given me greater wants than those of officers in general are scandalous proceedings often exposed to the greatest danger we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes we did the same with physicians whom we often sent halfdressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought a great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the church wardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits in every one of the perishes of the city of venice there is a large public house called magazino yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way the waiter of the magazine came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due in joining silence under penalty of death we took our three prisoners to a large boat where is my husband never fear you shall see him again tomorrow my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature beat us goodnight thanking us all with perfect good faith two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of it went on to say that the two men who had carried her off had taken her to such a place where they had and hour later been met by the other six and that they had all repaired to the two swords where they had spent an hour in drinking there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed i picked it up and coming up to him just to see what was going down the steps i hand it to him i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gandhalla saying that he would leave me at my house i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught resetta such a forcible lesson i inquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be blood again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me thinking i had the right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me will i thought it better to preserve a modest silence he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him the physician who attended him was named tarot he thought by some peculiar train of reasoning that he could cure him by applying a micurial ointment to the chest to which no one raised any objection delighted with such a fortunate result we lay down again he entreated me to tell him the truth what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i like to put i obeyed implicitly and met your exlency the three friends were astounded i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer they all ask me how long i would require to teach them the rules of my sublime calculus not very long i answered and i will teach you as you wish although the hermit assured me that i would die suddenly within three days if i communicated my science to anyone but i have no faith in whatever in that prediction they believe that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits and they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kindhearted to think them the work of the devil and ensued their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit there were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of screwpals as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undecieved them besides i found it very flattering to my vanity to become the subject of the speculative chattering of empty fools who having nothing else to do and always trying to find out the cause of every moral phenomena they mate with which their narrow intellect cannot understand whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gandola at your orders my own table in sequins a month you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your advisor and everything that may happen to you and everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude

standing, I found myself at twenty, a mediocre musician, forced to join a band due to poverty. I was aware that my former acquaintances would mock me, having known me as a doctor, ecclesiastic, and officer. I felt that I would only succeed through hypocrisy, and that I would despise myself even if I held the highest dignities.

As a musician, I was part of a group that often engaged in pranks, such as sending half-dressed physicians to noblemen and ringing church bells to frighten the parish. We also cut bell ropes, making it difficult for the church wardens to summon the faithful to early mass. Our antics often involved a large public house called Magazino, where we would take prisoners and engage in nocturnal orgies.

After a particularly wild night, I found myself on a gondola with a man who was dying. I helped him and was later introduced to his friends, who believed I possessed a mysterious calculus that could answer any question. They asked me to teach them the rules, and I agreed, despite the hermit's warning that I would die suddenly within three days if I shared my science. They believed that through me, they could find the secrets of every government in Europe and possess the philosopher's stone. Despite their good intentions, I knew that I was in a precarious situation, but I was flattered by their attention and decided to continue the charade. I was eventually offered a place to stay and a servant, and I threw myself at the man's feet, calling him my father.","As a young man with a respectable education, I found myself at 20, forced to join a musical band due to poverty.

His visits became less frequent, but he still pleaded his case with ardor, and Miss Woodley, who was present, couldn't help but wish him success. Meanwhile, Miss Whitley, who was watching, often heard a sigh escape from her, which she didn't notice until reminded, and then a sudden blush would spread across her face.

Night after night, Sir Edward's sleep was disturbed by fears for Miss Whitley, and morning after morning, he was woken by the sound of her return. One evening, Mrs. Horton asked Miss Whitley if she would stay at home, and when she refused, Sir Edward immediately left the room. Miss Whitley's hand fell motionless, and she appeared frozen, but Mrs. Horton's attempts to calm her down only made her tears flow. Miss Whitley's tears were not from any real cause of grief, but there was a magnetic quality to them that always drew hers out.

Later, Mr. Doraphorth and his ward, Miss Whitley, were summoned to tea. Doraphorth entered with a mixture of anger and absent-mindedness, and though he pretended to read a pamphlet, it was clear he was barely aware of it. Miss Whitley remained silent, and the atmosphere was tense. After a while, Miss Whitley entered the room, not dressed for a ball, and Doraphorth seemed afraid to look up, fearing he would see something he couldn't forgive. Eventually, he laid down the book and asked Miss Whitley if she would like some tea. He then rose from his chair and asked her to obey him again, promising to be more considerate in the future. Miss Whitley was about to reply, but found herself unable to speak without tears, so she desisted.

One evening, Mrs. Horton forbade Miss Milner from leaving the house, and Sir Edward, feeling rebuffed, departed. Miss Milner's tears flowed as she wept, not from genuine grief, but from the magnetic quality of tears.

Mrs. Basel was willing to have her husband earn his living by watching over Lady M. or her lover, and believed that ladies of quality were often untrustworthy.

a tree, but Sancho's thoughts kept him awake. He imagined himself in various places, including the cave of Maltesinos, where he saw a country wench transformed into a man. Meanwhile, Don Quixote remained awake, thinking about his master's words and the conditions for disenchanting Dalsania.

As they rested, Sancho got up and attacked Don Quixote, holding him down and refusing to let him go. Don Quixote promised not to touch Sancho's garments and to leave him free to whip himself. Sancho then felt something touch his head and, trembling with fear, moved to another tree, where the same thing happened. Don Quixote intervened, asking Sancho what was wrong. Sancho replied that the trees were full of men's feet and legs.

Later, Don Quixote and Sancho encountered a group of men who were about to rifle Sancho's girdle. Don Quixote ordered them to desist, and they obeyed. Sancho then told Don Quixote that he had a plan to win the heart of a beautiful woman, and Don Quixote agreed to help. Sancho's plan involved going to a monastery to find his beloved, but he refused to let Don Quixote accompany him. The two parted ways, with Sancho vowing to make the woman his.

Meanwhile, a wounded gentleman was found, and he recognized Claudia, the woman he loved. He told her that she had killed him, and Claudia was overcome with grief. She had planned to marry another man, Leonora, but the gentleman's words revealed her deceit. The servants wept, and the gentleman fainted away. Claudia vowed to enter a monastery, leaving her unhappy fate behind. Sancho and Don Quixote then encountered a group of people, including a knight-errant who offered to show them how to become one. The group was met with a coach full of women and their attendants, and the captains were concerned about the regents lady's share of the spoils. The pilgrims were upset about their property being confiscated, and the regents lady ordered her servant to give her share of the crowns. The group was taken aback by the captain's generosity, and they all remained silent in deference to him.","Don Quixote and his squire, Sancho, are resting under a tree when Sancho falls asleep, but Don Quixote remains awake, lost in thought.

Mr. Meakin, a newcomer to the colony, was introduced to the group, and they discussed the recent marriage of John Rex, a former convict. The conversation turned to the topic of corporal punishment, with some members advocating for it, while others, like Reverend Meacon, expressed reservations.

As they walked to the veranda, they encountered Dr. McElwain, who had been delayed due to an accident. The group discussed the upcoming flogging of a prisoner, with Dr. McElwain suggesting that it might be unnecessary. Reverend North, however, was adamant that the punishment should proceed.

among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions it is a gross mistake therefore when historians of morals start with questions like why have sympathetic actions been praised he honors whatever he recognizes in himself such morality equals selfglorification probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression perhaps a condemnation of man together with his situation here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised according to slave morality therefore the evil man arouses fear according to master morality it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the word good and stupid or he will even say for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others perhaps because i love and honor them and rejoice in all their joys perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion perhaps because the good opinion of others even in cases where i do not share it is useful to me or gives promise of usefulness all this however is not vanity in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the original noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ample and more

scale of values and differences in human worth will always require slavery in some form. The origins of moral values are rooted in the distinctions between ruling and ruled classes, with the nobility in ancient Greece calling themselves ""truthful ones."" Historians of morals mistakenly start with questions about why sympathetic actions are praised, as morality is often self-glorification.

The antithesis of good and evil is rooted in the fear and dreadfulness of evil, which is assumed to reside in the evil individual. In contrast, master morality sees the good individual as arousing fear and seeking to do so. The blending of blood between masters and slaves has led to the rise of democratic social orders, encouraging the original noble impulse to assign value to oneself and think well of oneself.

However, this impulse is opposed by an older propensity for vanity, which develops virtues and attaches itself to individuality. As individuals dare to be individual, they manifest a ""magnificent manifold virginforestlike upgrowth and upstriving,"" with decay and self-destruction resulting from the rivalry of egoisms. The problem of morality in this democratic age is the need to deceive and mislead about one's origin and plebeianism, as the noble soul accepts its egoism without question.

In this context, the concept of justice is rooted in the primary law of things, and nations understand one another better when they share a common language and history. The need to agree quickly and readily about what is necessary arises from the danger and uncertainty of life, and the structure of one's soul is revealed through one's estimates of value. The highest instinct for purity can lead to extraordinary isolation, as seen in the case of saints. Ultimately, the problem of morality is one of understanding oneself and one's place in the world.","A society believing in a hierarchical scale of worth and requiring slavery will always be the foundation for elevations of humanity. The origins of moral values are rooted in the ruling class's self-perception, with the nobility in ancient Greece calling themselves ""truthful ones."" The distinction between good and evil is based on the assumption that evil is powerful and dangerous, while good is weak and noble. As democratic societies rise, the impulse to assign value to oneself and think well of oneself will be encouraged, but this will be opposed by an older propensity for vanity, which develops virtues and values. In this context, moral philosophers will struggle to preach morality, as the individual's desires and volitions become the source of danger and corruption. The problem of race in a democratic age is how to educate and culture individuals to accept their egoism without question, and to understand the concept of justice as a primary law of things.","The text discusses the origins of morality, the distinction between slave and master morality, and the role of vanity in human society, concluding that the rise of democratic social orders has led to a blending of bloodlines and a decline in the original noble impulse to assign value to oneself.",4,4,4,4,"The summary provides a clear and concise overview of the original text, covering the main points about the origins of moral values, the antithesis of good and evil, and the problem of morality in a democratic age.

The Manikians believed that the absolute and the will could sometimes give way, and that God himself could abdicate for a time.

Gwen Plain's appearance was further characterized by his yellow hair, which was likely dyed with a corrosive preparation, making it rough and woolly to the touch. His hair covered a lofty brow that seemed made to contain thought, and his head structure was unaffected by the mysterious operation that had transformed his face. Despite his unusual appearance, Gwen Plain had the resources of a gymnast and an athlete, suggesting that he was physically fit and capable.","Gwyn Plain, a mountebank, displayed a perpetual, artificial laugh that was contagious, yet he himself did not laugh. His face was a product of a mysterious, occult science that had manipulated his features at a young age, creating a countenance that was both joyful and unsettling. Despite his emotions, his face remained frozen in a rictus, as if his laughter was a mechanical response rather than a genuine expression. His appearance was further enhanced by his athletic build, yellow hair, and a lofty brow, which seemed to contain a wealth of thought. The manikians believed that the absolute could sometimes give way, and that God himself might abdicate, but Gwyn Plain's laugh was an eternal, unchanging phenomenon.","Gwen Plain's artificial laughter, created through mysterious and occult means, is an everlasting and mechanical phenomenon that is both a tribute to joy and a testament to the manipulation of his facial features.",4,4,4,5,"The summary is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear and concise language.

The negotiations between the captured garrison and their captors were soon completed, and the great state of Virginia left the Union. Harry, who had been fighting in Charleston, heard that the Confederacy was now secure and that President Davis's progress to the new capital would be a huge triumph of faith and loyalty.

Harry felt a sense of pride but not showed it, saluting and leaving the room to gather his belongings. He intended to leave early the next morning, but first, he said goodbye to his friends, feeling deep regret. Four months had changed Harry, and he bore himself more gravely, having seen great things and done his share. He gazed upon a world full of responsibilities and perils but looked back at Charleston with real affection.

As Harry left Charleston, he felt the difference in the air, which was cooler and more prone to look at both sides of a question. He reached the little station of Wynton and left the train, where he met a tall, sturdy boy named Bill Skellian, who was a mountaineer. Harry thanked him through his saddlebags and rode away, giving a final wave to the sympathetic liveryman. This was not the fashion of a year ago, when they exchanged friendly words, but Harry knew the cause now – nobody could trust anybody else. However, he saw nothing unusual, with no signal lights twinkling.","Harry, a young soldier, returned to his native Kentucky after the fall of Charleston, where he had fought alongside his comrades. As he left the city, he felt a mix of emotions, including sadness and triumph, but was determined to move forward. He was greeted with a cooler and more cautious atmosphere in Kentucky, where people were more likely to consider both sides of an issue. Harry, now more mature and grave, rode away from the train station, feeling a sense of responsibility and peril, but also a deep affection for the place he was leaving behind. He was met with a sense of unease, as nobody could be trusted, but he was determined to move forward, leaving the tumultuous events of the past behind.","Harry, a young soldier, returns home to Kentucky after the fall of Charleston, feeling changed by his experiences and carrying a mix of emotions as he navigates a divided nation.",4,4,4,4,"The summary maintains a good level of fluency, with a clear and concise writing style.

Upon arriving at Mary's, Joseph sat down by the fire and began to play his violin. Mary and her sister Letty listened in silence, moved by the beauty of the music. Letty was overcome with emotion, and Mary's heart swelled with tears. The music seemed to transcend their mortal lives, connecting them to something eternal and divine.

As Joseph played, he felt a sense of ecstasy, as if his love for music and his love for Mary were merging into one. He felt a deep sense of connection to the universe, and his violin seemed to become an extension of his being. In that moment, he felt his love for Mary and his love for music were one and the same, a reflection of the divine love that existed beyond human comprehension.

The music ended, and Joseph's violin lay broken on the floor. But in that moment, he felt his being made whole, his treasure taken, and a woman given to him instead.

He argued that in their natural state, they would not be forced to climb up a tall stick, and that the pots protected them from wire worms that could destroy their roots. The plants, however, seemed to disagree, and the wind, taking on a mischievous tone, began to question the necessity of the gardener's care.

As the wind's whispers spread throughout the garden, the flowers trembled with a mix of fear and pleasure. The wind knocked over the convolvulus pole, tore down the white lily's support, and freed the carnation flowers from their fastenings. The rose tree was broken, and the sweet peas were leveled to the ground. The once-orderly garden was now in disarray, with weeds sprouting up everywhere.

The gardener, returning from his farm work, was shocked by the sight before him. The young lady, who had been standing in the garden, was approached by her mother, who asked if she was thinking about the garden. The young girl replied that they could plant new flowers and re-tie some of the existing ones. The mother's words seemed to calm the young girl, and the two of them began to plan for the garden's restoration. The gardener's care, once questioned by the wind, was now reaffirmed by the mother's words, and the garden's beauty was restored.","A gardener's care is unnecessary, as plants can thrive naturally without human intervention, argued a young girl. However, a mischievous wind disagreed, suggesting that the gardener's care is necessary to support the plants' growth and beauty. The wind's playful teasing led to chaos in the garden, knocking over poles, breaking stems, and leveling flowers. When the gardener returned, he was shocked by the disarray, and the young girl's mother reassured her that they could replant and restore the garden to its former beauty.","The gardener's care and props, which he believes are necessary for the flowers' survival, are actually causing them distress and chaos, and the young girl longs to restore the garden to its natural state.",4,4,4,3,"The summary is well-written and easy to follow, but it loses some of the whimsical tone and poetic language of the original text.

Dukalian and his companion, Pira, were saddened by the desolation, longing to see the land filled with people once more.

Mother Magpie agreed to teach them, but only if they would be patient, diligent, and obedient.

The neighbors believed the trouble came from poor upbringing or lack of upbringing altogether. The family's unusual habits, such as eating plain food and not eating between meals, contributed to their negative reputation.

The family, which had six legs and three joints in each leg, was slow-moving and did not breathe through their mouths or gills. Instead, they took in oxygen through openings in the back of their bodies. The larvae, or young, had small upper lips but larger lower lips that were connected to a jointed arm-like structure with pincers used for catching food.

As the larvae grew, they developed the ability to straighten their jointed arms and hold their lower lips out before them, using their pincers to catch food. However, they were also cautious and would often retreat when threatened. In this case, they sensed the presence of a snappy turtle and quickly escaped as it began to draw in its legs, preparing to take a nap.

His translation of the Vita Nuova, a collection of poems and prose, was well-received and established his reputation as a poet and translator. Rossetti believed that the goal of translating poetry was to make it accessible to a new nation, not to simply render it into a new language.

In his translations, Rossetti prioritized the original poem's beauty and structure over the nuances of his own idiom and epoch. He would often adapt his translation to fit the rhythm and rhyme of the original, even if it meant weakening the poem's natural cadence. Rossetti acknowledged the importance of his translators' notes, thanking them for their work and acknowledging the value of their revisions.

The Vita Nuova is a collection of poems and prose that explores themes of love, beauty, and mortality. The title, which translates to ""New Life,"" has been interpreted by some editors as referring to Dante's early life. Rossetti's translation of the Vita Nuova captures the essence of Dante's work, conveying the poet's unique voice and style to a new audience. Throughout the translation, Rossetti's own poetic voice is evident, adding depth and nuance to the original work.","Gabriele Rossetti translated Italian poems, including Dante's Vita Nuova, into English, establishing his reputation as a poetic translator.

One day, certain ladies, familiar with the writer's troubles, gathered together for social company. When the writer remained silent, one of the ladies addressed them by name, saying that they couldn't bear the lady's presence and that their master, in his goodness, had placed their happiness where their hope would not fail.

The ladies began to converse closely, and the writer declared that love filled them with perfect sweetness, making them strong despite their weakness. They went along the road, accompanied by the lady, and the writer's courage did not fail. The second part of the poem is divided into two sections, with the first describing the lady's nobility of soul, highlighting her virtues, and the second describing her nobility of body, detailing her beauties. The writer's purpose is to speak of the lady's eyes, which are the beginning of love, and her mouth, which is the end of love.","I, a sonnet writer, felt compelled to express my condition in verse, and after a gathering of ladies who knew my troubles, one addressed me by name, saying I couldn't handle her presence, and that my master's goodness had placed my happiness where my hope wouldn't fail.
